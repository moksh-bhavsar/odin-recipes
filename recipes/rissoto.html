        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Saffron was originally used for flavour and its signature yellow colour.</p> 
        <p>Risotto in Italy is normally a first course served before the main course, but risotto alla milanese is often served with ossobuco alla milanese as a main course.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups loosely packed arugula, or more to taste</li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil </li>   
            <li> 2 cups Arborio rice </li>   
            <li> ½ cup finely chopped yellow onion </li>   
            <li> ½ cup white wine </li>   
            <li> 6 cups vegetable broth </li>   
            <li> ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>   
            <li> 2 tablespoons butter </li>   
            <li> 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>   
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop arugula and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute rice in the hot oil until it begins to look toasted, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in wine and stir frequently until most of the liquid is absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>

            <li> Stir in vegetable broth, 1 cup at a time, stirring almost constantly. Add arugula with the 5th cup of vegetable broth; pour in remaining broth, stirring almost constantly, until rice is tender yet firm to the bite, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
            
            <li> Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese and butter. Add salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        </ol>
